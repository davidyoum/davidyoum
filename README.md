## Coding Things/About Me

I'm 17 and just recently fell in love with programming. I started taking Computer Programming classes in junior year and kept expanding my knowledge on Computer Science and Programming. I love teaching people things that I learn so thats why I love teaching in my classes and also on YouTube.

Languages I'm Currently Learning:

I'm always learning new languages and libraries every single day.

What I use to code is VSCode and Sublime Text. The reason I use both is just how simple the design is. I like things simple and I like to keep things simple. You might say im a minimalist.
